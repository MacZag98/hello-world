# hello-world
My first ropository

Hello there!
I'm a student of teleinformatics on the University of Science and Technology in Wroclaw in Poland. Two things that I could do all the time is coding and watching TVseries, but unfortunatlu I do the second thing more often. :/
Beside coding I dance a lot (about four hours per week) and write theatrical scenarios.
