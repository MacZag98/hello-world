# hello-world
My first ropository

Hello there!
I'm a student of teleinformatics on the University of Science and Technology in Wroclaw in Poland. Two things that I could do all the time is programming and watching TVseries, but unfortunatly I do the second thing more often. :/
Beside coding I dance a lot and by that I mean more than ten hours for a week.
